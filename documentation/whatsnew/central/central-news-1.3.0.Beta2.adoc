== New Hybrid Mobile project wizard 	

JBoss Central now features the Hybrid Mobile Project wizard to let you kickstart new Cordova-based mobile applications.

If the Hybrid Mobile Toolkit is not installed, you'll be asked to install it, as well as a few useful companion features (CordovaSim, BrowserSim). When using JBoss Tools you'll also be offered to add LiveReload and the Visual Plugin Editor, if these features are not already installed. 

The Spring Project wizard, that was previously featured on JBoss Central, is still available in the File > New > Project... menu.
