We have been working for a while on doing a refresh of our website and today we are happy to announce http://tools.jboss.org[tools.jboss.org].

We had a few goals for the website:

. Make it simple and clear to download the plugins
. Explain what features are in the tools
. Include New and noteworthy 
. Make it easier to update/fix the content

and I think we reached all of them. 

== Make it simple and clear to download the plugins

Our old download page had grown organically of the last 7 years and despite all good intentions we had ended up with a download
page with way too many options presented by default. With the new site we went for simplicity first thus the Downloads page
now simply present you with two options: Download: latest stable JBoss Tools or Developer Studio.

If you want other versions, combinations, add-ons etc. you can follow the link:/downloads/overview[Overview] link which will give all the dirty details.



== Explain what features are in the tools

For this we created the link:/features[Features] page. This page gives an overview over all of the various projects/technologies we
support and if you click on the images you get more information about each feature.

Try it out - you might be surprised how much we actually do.

 
Have fun!
